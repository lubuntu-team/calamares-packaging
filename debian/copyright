           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
        5. Downstream recipients.
 .
             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                Public License.
 .
             b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                Material.
 .
        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
   b. Other rights.
 .
        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
           Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
           Public License.
 .
        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
           reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
   a. Attribution.
 .
        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
           form), You must:
 .
             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                with the Licensed Material:
 .
                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                     Material and any others designated to receive
                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                     designated);
 .
                 ii. a copyright notice;
 .
                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                     warranties;
 .
                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                     extent reasonably practicable;
 .
             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
           information.
 .
        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
           reasonably practicable.
 .
        4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
           License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
           Material from complying with this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
      portion of the contents of the database;
 .
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 .
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
      waiver of all liability.
 .
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
      terminate automatically.
 .
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
           violation; or
 .
        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.
 .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
      will not terminate this Public License.
 .
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
      License.
 .
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
      be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.
 .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
      Licensor.
 .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
